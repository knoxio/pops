# Epic 05: Meal Planning & Batches

> Theme: [Food](../README.md)

## Scope

Build the surfaces that turn PRD-111's `plan_entries` and PRD-108's `batches` / `recipe_runs` / `batch_consumptions` from schema into a working meal-prep loop. A week-grid planning page (`/food/plan`) where the user drags recipes into slots; a "Mark cooked" / "Cook now" modal that runs the FIFO consumption against the fridge and produces a yielded batch; a fridge inventory view (`/food/fridge`) that browses every batch with location grouping and expiry sort; per-batch edit affordances (relocate, change expiry, delete).

After this epic, the user can plan Sunday batch-prep on Saturday, cook on Sunday, see the yielded batches land in `/food/fridge` with auto-calculated expiry, then plan Tuesday's plate that consumes those batches FIFO. The full meal-prep loop closes.

This epic is **not** plan-derived shopping (Epic 07), substitutions (Epic 06), or the "what should I cook tonight" solver (Epic 06). Just plan + cook + fridge.

### Build order

```
143 ──► 144 ──► (145, 146 in parallel) ──► 147
```

- **PRD-143** first — the plan grid is the most prominent surface and the entry point for cook events. Plan entry CRUD API also unblocks PRD-144.
- **PRD-144** owns the cook modal shell. It depends on PRD-143's plan entry API for the "Mark cooked" entry point.
- **PRDs 145 and 146** specialise the cook modal (PRD-145 = batch creation; PRD-146 = consumption preview / shortfalls) and can be built in parallel after PRD-144's shell exists.
- **PRD-147** is independent of the cook flow but consumes PRD-145's batch services for the row-level edit actions. Lands last.

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** Epic 00 (especially PRD-107 `recipe_versions`, PRD-108 `batches` / `recipe_runs` / `batch_consumptions` + FIFO helper, PRD-111 `plan_entries` + `plan_slots`, PRD-113 seed data).
- **Requires:** Epic 01 (PRD-118 module shell mounting; PRD-119 `food.recipes.*` router and `RecipeDetailPage` for the "Cook now" entry; PRD-121 renderer for the inline view in the cook modal).
- **Requires:** Epic 00 services exposed by PRD-108 — `consumeForRun(needs, db)`, `markRunComplete(runId, opts)` — both called transactionally inside PRD-144's cook mutation.
- **Unlocks:** Epic 06 (substitution-aware consumption layers on PRD-146's surface). Epic 07 (plan-derived shopping list consumes PRD-143's date-range query).

| Plan grid layout        | Week × slot grid (Mon-Sun columns × N slot rows, ordered by `plan_slots.display_order`). Mobile (<768px) collapses to a day-at-a-time swiper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Week-at-a-glance matches the batch-prep mental model; columns map to grocery / prep rhythm. Mobile pivot keeps the surface usable on a phone in the kitchen                      |
| Week boundary           | ISO weeks (Monday-Sunday), local timezone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Matches most cooking calendars worldwide; Sunday-Saturday confuses meal-prep planning that treats Sunday as the prep day                                                         |
| Cook event UX           | Single "Mark cooked" modal — actual scale, yield qty (auto-fill + edit), location radio, rating 1-5, notes. Batches consumed shown read-only (FIFO defaults; overrideable via PRD-146)                                                                                                                                                                                        | One screen. Fewest taps. Wizard would add friction for the 80% case (cook as planned). PRD-146 layers in the override controls for the 20% case (shortfall, substitution)        |
| Ad-hoc cook entry       | Recipe detail page only — "Cook now" entry in PRD-119's action menu                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | One surface to learn. Plan-grid retroactive logging is satisfied by adding a back-dated plan entry then immediately Mark cooked                                                  |
| Cook transaction        | A new `food.cook.markCooked` tRPC mutation wraps `INSERT recipe_runs` + PRD-108's `consumeForRun` + `markRunComplete` in one Drizzle transaction. Plan entry's `recipe_run_id` is set in the same transaction iff the cook started from a plan entry                                                                                                                          | Atomic — either the cook is fully recorded (run row, consumed batches, yielded batch, plan link) or nothing is. Prevents zombie plan entries that point at runs that rolled back |
| Locations model         | Keep PRD-108's hardcoded enum (pantry / fridge / freezer / other). No ADR in this epic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The "extensible locations" ADR candidate is deferred. PRD-108's `'other'` value covers the long tail until inventory theme matures                                               |
| Plan entry edit         | Click a plan entry opens an inline edit sheet (not full page) with: servings, version pin, notes, "Mark cooked" button, link to recipe detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Keeps the user in the plan context. Sheet = side-panel on desktop, bottom-sheet on mobile                                                                                        |
| Reschedule              | Drag a plan entry between cells = update `(date, slot)`. Within a cell = reorder `position`. Touch: long-press → drag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Standard drag-drop UX; aligns with PRD-140's reorder pattern                                                                                                                     |
| Custom slots            | The plan page settings menu exposes a slot-CRUD surface (add a custom slot, rename, reorder, soft-delete). Default slots (`is_default=1`) can be reordered but not deleted                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PRD-111 already supports it at the schema layer; UI just needs to surface it                                                                                                     |
| Shortfall UX            | The cook modal lists every shortfalling line with two per-row options: (a) "Pick a batch to consume" (override the FIFO miss with a manual batch — may be a different variant if substitutions UI lands later), or (b) "Mark consumed externally" (record the consumption-need but skip writing a `batch_consumptions` row). Submit blocked until every shortfall is resolved | Prevents accidentally cooking with nothing tracked while leaving an escape hatch for "I used the one from the cupboard I forgot to log"                                          |
| Fridge view default     | `/food/fridge` lists every batch with `qty_remaining > 0`, grouped by location (collapsible sections), sorted by `expires_at ASC NULLS LAST`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Expiry-first is the most actionable view. Location grouping mirrors physical reality                                                                                             |
| Batch row actions       | Per-row menu: Edit (qty + expiry + notes), Relocate (location radio), Delete (with confirm for non-empty), Cook now (recipe picker filtered to recipes consuming this variant)                                                                                                                                                                                                | "Cook now from batch" is a small power-user affordance; not the primary cook flow                                                                                                |
| Empty-batch retention   | Batches with `qty_remaining = 0` are hidden from `/food/fridge` by default; a "Show empties" toggle reveals them. Empty batches are never deleted on their own (preserved for cook history per PRD-108)                                                                                                                                                                       | Default surface stays focused on edible inventory; history is a click away                                                                                                       |
| Recipe-run history page | `/food/recipes/:slug/runs` (a sub-page of PRD-119's recipe detail) lists all `recipe_runs` for the recipe. Read-only in v1; clicking a row opens the cook detail (mini-modal)                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Closes the loop on "v3 was rated higher than v2" without a separate cook-history surface. Deferred to a small sub-PRD if needed                                                  |

## Risks

- **FIFO consumption surprises the user** — The default picks one batch over another; user may want a specific batch. Mitigation: PRD-146's override mode is one click away.
- **Cook modal becomes a god-form** — Scale + yield + location + rating + notes + consume preview + shortfalls + overrides is a lot. Mitigation: PRD-144 sets the modal scaffold (essentials always visible); PRD-146 layers shortfall+override as a collapsible panel that's hidden in the happy path.
- **Plan-entry drag races with cook completion** — User drags a plan entry while another tab marks it cooked. Mitigation: services check `plan_entries.recipe_run_id IS NULL` before applying drag updates; if non-null, the drag rejects with a toast.
- **Mobile drag-drop UX is finicky** — Long-press + drag on touch can mis-fire with scroll. Mitigation: PRD-143 uses an established library (react-dnd or equivalent — same as PRD-140's reorder); explicit "Move to..." menu fallback for accessibility.
- **Expiry-day calculations have timezone bugs** — `produced_at + N days` near midnight risks off-by-one. Mitigation: PRD-145 computes expiry in the user's local timezone using `date-fns`; tests pin the boundary cases.
- **Variant + prep_state combinatorial explosion in `/food/fridge`** — "Chicken breast diced", "Chicken breast sliced", "Chicken breast whole" each list separately. Mitigation: PRD-147 groups by `ingredient` first (collapsible), with variant + prep_state as sub-rows. The user sees "Chicken (3 batches)" by default and expands.
- **Batch deletion has cook-history implications** — Deleting a non-empty batch loses provenance. Mitigation: PRD-145's delete confirm explicitly warns; deletion sets `qty_remaining=0` + a `deleted_at` column (NEW per PRD-145) rather than hard-deleting. The cook history JOIN through `batch_consumptions` still resolves.
- **Plan-entry across recipe rename** — User renames a recipe's slug after planning; plan_entries.recipe_id is stable so the row still works. UI surfaces the current name regardless. No data risk.

## Out of Scope

- Plan-derived shopping list generation — **Epic 07**.
- Pantry subtraction in shopping (live "what do I still need?" check) — **Epic 07**.
- Substitution-aware consumption (allow consuming whole onion when recipe asks for diced) — **Epic 06**.
- "What can I cook tonight?" solver — **Epic 06**.
- Recurring plan entries ("Tuesday is taco night") — deferred.
- Plan templates / week templates — deferred.
- Expiry notifications / push alerts — theme-level decision (no notifications in v1).
- Cooking-mode full-screen view (timer-driven, voice-controlled) — out of scope for Epic 05; revisit post-Epic-05.
- Calendar export (.ics) — deferred.
- Batch QR codes / sticker printing — out of scope.
- Multi-output recipes (chicken → meat + bones + stock) — per ADR-022, single-yield only.
- Receipt scanning to auto-create purchase batches — out of scope (cross-domain with finance theme).
- Cook-history analytics (cuisine breakdown, monthly cook count) — out of scope.
- Bulk-mark-cooked across multiple plan entries — out of scope; one at a time.
- Inventory locations cross-domain ADR — explicitly deferred per the Key Decisions table.
