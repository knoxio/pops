# Epic 00: Schema & Foundations

> Theme: [Food](../README.md)

## Scope

Land all SQLite tables, indexes, constraints, invariants, and the recipe-DSL pipeline required by the food app. Each schema area or pipeline stage is its own PRD so they can be reviewed and merged independently; together they form the foundation every other epic builds on. Done when `mise db:init && mise db:seed:food` produces a coherent food database, all invariant and DSL tests pass, and `packages/db-types` exports the new types.

This epic is schema-and-data + the DSL parsing/resolving/compiling pipeline. No API procedures, no UI, no ingestion worker — those live in Epics 01, 02, and 03.

```

- **106** lands first (every other schema FKs into ingredients; `slug_registry` is its responsibility).
- **107** declares the recipe header tables AND the compile-state columns that PRD-116 writes.
- **114** is pure parser — no DB. Can technically be built any time after 107's contract is set; placed in the chain here because it feeds 115.
- **115** needs 106 (registry lookup) and 107 (recipes existing). Pure-function shape, read-only DB.
- **116** introduces `recipe_lines` and `recipe_steps` and the compile function. Calls 114 + 115 + 117.
- **117** is invoked from 116's compile; lives separately because the algorithm and tests are independent.
- **108–112** are independent schemas that can each be built in parallel once 116 is in (any cook-event / planning code reads `recipe_lines`).
- **113** is last — seed data exercises the union.

The DSL pipeline (107 → 114 → 115 → 116 → 117) is linear. Everything else fans out from 116.

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** Phase 1 foundation — Drizzle, migration tooling, `packages/db-types`. All present.
- **Unlocks:** Epic 01 (Recipe & Ingredient Management UI), Epic 02 (Ingestion Pipeline), and through them everything downstream.

## Out of Scope

- tRPC procedures and HTTP API (Epic 01 / 02 PRDs)
- Any UI — recipe editor, DSL autocomplete, error annotation, renderer (Epic 01 PRDs)
- The ingestion worker container (Epic 02)
- Conversion table (cup→ml, "1 medium onion" etc.) — deferred to an Epic 01 PRD; v1 compile handles only trivial g/ml/count carry-over
- Cross-domain entity links (finance / inventory) — separate themes
- Promotion of proposed slugs to real `slug_registry` entries — Epic 03 (review queue)
