# PRD-233: External pillar example (Rust reference)

> Epic: [Cross-language interop](../../epics/14-cross-language-interop.md)

> Status: In progress — proof-of-concept scaffolded

> Spec: [`pillar-wire-format-v1.md`](../../specs/pillar-wire-format-v1.md)

## Overview

A minimal Rust pillar that implements the [wire-format spec v1](../../specs/pillar-wire-format-v1.md) end-to-end. It exists to prove the spec is implementable from scratch in a non-TS language, validate the registration endpoint shipped in PRD-228, and serve as the canonical worked example for future Go / Python / Swift pillars. It is **not a deployment target** — it never runs in the home-lab docker-compose. Its only job is to pass `@pops/wire-conformance` end-to-end.

If `@pops/pillar-sdk` and this implementation disagree, the [spec](../../specs/pillar-wire-format-v1.md) is the tie-breaker — not either implementation.

### Discovery boundary

`examples/` is deliberately outside the workspace glob, so [PRD-241](../241-registry-driven-known-modules/README.md)'s build-time discovery walk over `@pops/*-contract` packages does not see this pillar — and never should. The Rust example reaches `core-api` via [ADR-027](../../../../architecture/adr-027-runtime-pillar-registry.md)'s runtime registry: it POSTs `core.registry.register` on boot (per [PRD-228](../228-dynamic-pillar-registration/README.md) §6) and is reflected in `pillar_registry` at runtime, not in `packages/module-registry/src/generated.ts`. PRD-241 (in-repo, build-time) and ADR-027 (external, runtime) are the two halves of the same discovery story; this PRD exercises the second.

### Consumer-side onboarding

A consumer in `pops/` calling into this Rust pillar uses `pillar('example-rust').callDynamic(routerName, procName, input, kind)` from `@pops/pillar-sdk`, not the typed `pillar('example-rust').<router>.<proc>` proxy. The Rust pillar's procedure shapes are not in the codegen-derived `AppRouter` catalogue ([PRD-242](../242-dynamic-approuter/README.md)), so consumers declare the response shape at the call site. See the developer note: [in-repo pillars vs external pillars](../../notes/internal-vs-external-pillar-call-sites.md).

## API Surface

The example implements the subset of v1 needed to demonstrate end-to-end correctness:

| Endpoint                             | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET  /manifest.json`                | `ManifestPayload` for pillar id `example-rust`, empty capability arrays. |
| `GET  /health`                       | `{ ok, status, pillar, version, ts }` healthy / unhealthy per §7.        |
| `POST /trpc/examplerust.hello.greet` | Reference success procedure — returns `{ greeting: "hello from rust" }`. |

On boot, the pillar POSTs `core.registry.register` per §6 using `POPS_INTERNAL_API_KEY`. Full-jitter exponential backoff up to 5 minutes per §6.5.

## Business Rules

- The manifest returned by `GET /manifest.json` MUST match the body sent at registration time.
- Pillar id is `example-rust` (kebab); procedure namespace is `examplerust` (no hyphens, per the `PROCEDURE_PATH` regex in `@pops/pillar-sdk/manifest-schema`).
- The example does NOT need to implement every `WF-*` assertion — subscriptions, batching, error-envelope edge cases are out of scope for the proof-of-concept. The README documents which assertions are covered.
- No persistence, no DB, no config files. Env vars only.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `cargo build --release` succeeds against the pinned `axum` toolchain.
- [x] `GET /manifest.json` returns a body that parses with `@pops/pillar-sdk/manifest-schema` `ManifestPayloadSchema`.
- [x] `GET /health` returns `200 { ok: true, status: "healthy", pillar: "example-rust", ... }`.
- [x] `POST /trpc/examplerust.hello.greet` with `{ "input": null }` returns `{ result: { data: { greeting: "hello from rust" } } }`.
- [x] On boot, POSTs `core.registry.register` with `X-Internal-API-Key` and retries with backoff on transient failure.
- [x] README documents how to run `@pops/wire-conformance` against the running container.
- [ ] `WF-13-manifest-shape`, `WF-14-manifest-cache-control`, `WF-17-health-healthy`, `WF-01-single-call-success` pass when run from `@pops/wire-conformance` (covered subset).

## Out of Scope

- Subscriptions (`WF-08`…`WF-12`).
- Batched call shape (`WF-04`…`WF-07`).
- Production deployment, CI image publication, watchtower auto-rollout.
- A second non-TS language (Go / Python). Defer until this one is stable.
- Search adapter / AI tool / sink contributions. The example declares empty capabilities.
