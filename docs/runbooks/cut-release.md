# Runbook: Cut a Pops Release

> Audience: anyone with `write` access to `knoxio/pops`.
> Frequency: when the compose contract changes (network names, secret names, env var renames, image names) or when a stable point is worth marking.

## TL;DR

1. Land changes on `main` using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:` for breaking).
2. The `Release` workflow runs on push to main, bumps the version, tags `vX.Y.Z` at the current HEAD, and creates a GitHub Release with the grouped changelog — no commit on main, no PR ceremony.
3. The new `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers `Publish Images` to publish `ghcr.io/knoxio/pops-{api,shell}:vX.Y.Z` (plus `X.Y`, `X`, and unprefixed forms).
4. Update any deployer that pins `POPS_IMAGE_TAG` (knoxio lab tracks `main` via Watchtower, so no action needed there).

The full changelog history lives in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/knoxio/pops/releases) — there's no in-repo `CHANGELOG.md`. The repo ruleset requires all changes to main to go through a PR, so the workflow is tag-only by design.

## When to cut

Cut a release when **any** of these change in a way deployers can observe:

- service names (`pops-api`, `pops-shell`, `pops-worker`)
- network names (`pops-frontend`, `pops-backend`, `pops-documents`)
- volume names (`pops-sqlite-data`, `pops-redis-data`, `pops-paperless-*`, `pops-metabase-data`)
- secret names (any of the 10 files in `secrets/`)
- env vars consumed by compose (`POPS_IMAGE_TAG`, `POPS_DOMAIN`, `PAPERLESS_BASE_URL`, …)
- the image names or registries themselves

Internal app refactors that don't change the compose contract don't need a release cut — the `main` and `sha-*` tags are sufficient for fresh deployers.

## Versioning scheme

Semver on git tag: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `v0.1.0`, `v1.2.3`).

| Bump  | Trigger                                                                                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MAJOR | Breaking compose-contract change (renamed service, removed network, mandatory new env var)          |
| MINOR | Backwards-compatible additions (new optional env var, new container, new secret with empty default) |
| PATCH | Bug fixes, doc-only changes, internal app changes published in lockstep                             |

We're pre-1.0, so the release script collapses `major` bumps into `minor` (breaking changes don't promote to `v1.0.0` until the bump is explicit). Once we tag `v1.0.0`, MAJOR is reserved for breakage.

## Conventional Commits cheat sheet

[`.github/scripts/release.sh`](../../.github/scripts/release.sh) reads commit subjects on `main` since the last `v*` tag to compute the next version + CHANGELOG section.

| Commit prefix                               | Bump                    | Goes in CHANGELOG section |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `feat: …`                                   | minor                   | Features                  |
| `fix: …`                                    | patch                   | Bug Fixes                 |
| `perf: …`                                   | patch                   | Performance               |
| `feat!: …` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer      | major (→ minor pre-1.0) | Features                  |
| `docs: …`                                   | none                    | Documentation             |
| `ci: …` / `build: …`                        | none                    | CI/CD / Build             |
| `revert: …`                                 | none                    | Reverts                   |
| `chore:` / `refactor:` / `test:` / `style:` | none                    | Hidden                    |

`docs`, `ci`, `build`, `revert` appear in the changelog but don't drive a version bump on their own — they only show up if at least one `feat` / `fix` / `perf` / breaking commit triggers a release.

## How a release happens

```text
commits land on main (Conventional Commits)
        │
        ▼
release.yml runs on push to main
        │
        ▼
.github/scripts/release.sh:
  - reads commits since the last vX.Y.Z tag
  - computes bump from conventional commit types
  - writes release-notes.md (grouped changelog)
        │
        ▼
job creates annotated tag vX.Y.Z at HEAD + pushes the tag
        │
        ▼
gh release create publishes the GitHub Release with the notes
        │
        ▼
publish-images.yml triggers on tag push, builds + tags:
  ghcr.io/knoxio/pops-api:vX.Y.Z, X.Y.Z, vX.Y, X.Y, vX, X
  ghcr.io/knoxio/pops-shell:vX.Y.Z, X.Y.Z, vX.Y, X.Y, vX, X
```

## Manual escape hatch

If the release workflow is broken or the bump is wrong, cut the tag by hand from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Then write release notes in the GitHub Release UI. The image publish workflow runs on any `v*` tag push regardless of who created it.

## Pinning a release as a deployer

```bash
echo 'POPS_IMAGE_TAG=v0.1.0' >> .env
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Watchtower will not roll forward as long as the resolved digest doesn't move. To resume tracking `main`:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/^POPS_IMAGE_TAG=.*/POPS_IMAGE_TAG=main/' .env
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## First-time setup checklist (one-off)

- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml` + `.github/scripts/release.sh`
- [x] `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml` includes `type=semver` patterns for the `v*` tag trigger
- [ ] First `vX.Y.Z` tag cut to exercise the pipeline end-to-end
